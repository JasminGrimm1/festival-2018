Using selected series, Banz and Bowinkel show their development from classical painting to a computer-artist duo. They provide insights and backgrounds into their topics, which arise from the examination of our digitized present.

<p>
Giulia Bowinkel and Friedemann Banz form the artist duo Banz & Bowinkel. In their work, Banz & Bowinkel deal with the computer as an everyday medium and its influence on our society.
</p>
<p>
The focus here is on the perception of the world, which humans nderstand as reality and which can now be simulated with the help of computers. 
</p>
<p>
The award-winning works by Banz & Bowinkel have been exhibited in numerous exhibitions in Germany and abroad, including the NRW Forum Düsseldorf, the Haus der elektronischen Künste in Basel and the Museum Abteiberg in Mönchengladbach.
